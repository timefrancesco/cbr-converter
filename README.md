A simple application to convert .cbr/.cbz to pdf and .pdf to .cbz.
Select a file or a folder and check the desidered option.
If you select a folder, all the files inside the folder will be converted.
If you check "Reduce file size" the output file size will be about the half of the input one.
The ouput file will be created in the same folder of the selected input or folder.

NOTE: Not every PDF can be converted.
